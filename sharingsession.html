                            Need help, I am struggling and feeling overwhelmed right now.
							I hate that I cannot sleep well everyday. I don't have the energy daily. I'm just addicted to TikTok, Bigo, Instagram and Facebook. I've wasted such much time I could cry. I feel so alone. My social interaction also gone worse when I"m just staying at home. I feel like I am horrible to be around. I know I had to do something. But I just feel trying is not worth it. I want to change but I don't feel like it. Very contradicting of myself.

                            Vader, I am glad that you are able to share it out to us right here. It is a very good thing because you already have the awareness of yourself. It is ok to feel overwhelmed. It is ok to struggle and not able to change right away. The thing would make you feel better would be forgiving yourself first. @Kitty, feel free to share your story to help out our community member

					    <p>Got it. First, I do really want to congratulate you that you have enough courage to share it with us. Also, start having forgiveness on yourself. After that, focus on small simple steps then go one step at a time. Do the thing you want to achieve first. It doesn't has to be serious stuff. Could be something you enjoy previously like a hobby. Definitely not scrolling social media. At the time being, try treat yourself with better foods.</p>
